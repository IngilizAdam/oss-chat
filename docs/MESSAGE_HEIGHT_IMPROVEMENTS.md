# Message Height Improvements

## Problem Fixed
The assistant response text boxes were too small (only one line high) and required scrolling to see the full content, making the chat interface difficult to use.

## Solution Implemented

### 🔧 **Dynamic Height Calculation**
```python
# Calculate proper height based on content length
lines = display_text.split('\n')
estimated_lines = max(1, len(lines))

# Add extra lines for text wrapping (approximate 80 chars per line)
for line in lines:
    if len(line) > 80:
        estimated_lines += (len(line) // 80)

# Set minimum height and scale with content
min_height = 30  # Increased from 25
line_height = 20  # Increased from 18
calculated_height = max(min_height, estimated_lines * line_height)

# Cap maximum height based on message type
max_height = 400 if message_type == "assistant" else 200  # Increased limits
final_height = min(calculated_height, max_height)
```

### 📏 **Improved Sizing Parameters**
- **Minimum Height**: 30px (up from 25px)
- **Line Height**: 20px (up from 18px) 
- **Assistant Max Height**: 400px (up from 300px)
- **User Max Height**: 200px (up from 150px)
- **Container Height**: 400px (up from 300px)

### 🎨 **Enhanced Visual Design**
- **Message Spacing**: 8px between messages (up from 5px)
- **Visual Separators**: Subtle lines between messages
- **Better Borders**: Added subtle borders and rounded corners
- **Improved Padding**: 8px padding (up from 5px)
- **Background Contrast**: More visible message backgrounds

### 🔄 **Dynamic Height Updates**
Added `_update_message_field_height()` method that:
- Recalculates height when assistant responses are updated
- Handles streaming responses that grow over time
- Maintains proper sizing during real-time updates

### 🎯 **Text Wrapping Intelligence**
- Estimates line wrapping at ~80 characters per line
- Accounts for multi-line content
- Handles long responses gracefully
- Prevents extremely tall boxes with reasonable maximum heights

## Expected Results

✅ **No More Scrolling**: Messages display at proper height  
✅ **Better Readability**: Increased padding and line height  
✅ **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear separation between messages  
✅ **Dynamic Sizing**: Heights adjust based on content length  
✅ **Professional Look**: Enhanced styling with borders and spacing  

## Usage Examples

**Short Message**: 30px minimum height  
**Medium Response**: Scales to ~100-200px based on content  
**Long Assistant Response**: Up to 400px with scrolling if needed  
**Multi-line Code**: Proper height for code snippets and formatted text

The chat interface now provides a much better user experience with properly sized message boxes that eliminate the need for constant scrolling while maintaining a clean, organized appearance.
